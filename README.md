# nscan
It is a simple bash based program that acts like nmap for non rooted android mobiles. It scans the network to display address and number of devices present in the network.

## Instructions
To run the porgram you'll need the TERMUX app which can be found in the play store.  
in TERMUX app...  
1- Run "termux-setup-storage" and allow permissions  
2- Use commands like (same as bash) to find the nscan file downloaded  
 - "ls" to list files in current directory  
 - "cd" to change directory  
 - "cp" or "mv" to copy or move files across directories  

3- Being in the same directory as the 'nscan' program. Run  
`bash nscan <ip/gateway address> <lower limit> <upper limit>`  
Note: I would recomment running the below command once  
`chmod +x nscan`  
so you can run the program using  
`./nscan <ip/gateway address> <lower limit> <upper limit>`  
Example:  
  `./nscan 192.168.1.0 100 255`  
Here we are tell the program to scan all the ip addresses from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.255.  

## Extra notes
 - ip/gateway address : refers to your ip-address or router (you can find this by using the `ifconfig` in TERMUX and observing the inet value for wlan0 adapter)  
 - lower limit        : this takes an integer value that tells the program the lowest address to start from. (includes this number)  
 - upper limit        : this takes an integer calue that tells the porgram the highest adress to end at. (includes this number)  

run `exit` command to exit TERMUX.
